# Democratia

Democratia is a web application built during the Facebook Hackaton @EPFL in 2015.
The main idea was to connect the swiss population with their local representants.

There is a comment system where users can log using the Facebook api, and rate comments.
The rails server is located in the server/ folder, it requires Rails 4 or greater.

Happy Hacking
